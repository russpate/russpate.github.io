          <p class="category-title hideme">intro</p>
          <h5 class="hideme">In May of 2016 --</h5>
          <h6 class="hideme">I started this as a place to feature my Front End Development work. Now about a year after finishing the The Iron Yard in Charleston, SC this has become a place to write, share, express, educate, complain or just explore.</h6>
          <h6 class="hideme">
            My strength lies in design. Attending a code school gave me <i>some</i> skills to build a better internet but my real passion will always be in the visual side of life.

          <h5 class="hideme">Mind the Gaps by Ira Glass</h5>
          <h6 class="hideme">“What nobody tells people who are beginners — and I really wish someone had told this to me . . . is that all of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, and it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not.</h6>
          <h6 class="hideme">
            But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase. They quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know it’s normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story.
          </h6>
          <h6 class="hideme">
            It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. It’s gonna take awhile. It’s normal to take awhile. You’ve just gotta fight your way through.”

          <h5 class="hideme">Design</h5>
          <h6 class="hideme">There isn't much left of my development projects from the The Iron Yard. I learned a ton about programmatic thinking, object oriented this and that, keepin' things DRY, and my hope is that those principles will continue to be applied in design. You can see some of the work I am fortunate enough to contribute to at Whiteboard on my website <a href="http://russpate.com/">russpate.com</a></h6>
